This is a data science capstone project that showcases the earthquake activity and resiliency in the Philippines for the year 2024 and 2025. It serves as the developers' final requirement in their **CS 132: Introduction to Data Science** course in the University of the Philippines - Diliman.

## Description and Purpose
Aside from the concurrent conflict the Philippines has to face regarding flood issues, earthquakes are also one of the major disaster risk that the Philippines has to face as it lies in the Pacific Ring of Fire. With the surge of earthquake-related news in recent months, including the notable events in Cebu, our group of data science researchers chose this topic under **SDG 13: Climate Action.** 

To support preparedness and disaster risk reduction across the country, this study analyzes earthquake frequency, magnitude, and Seismic Risk Potential (SRP) for 2024–2025 across all Philippine regions. The goal is to identify areas that require higher prioritization for earthquake resilience, mitigation, and adaptation planning.
